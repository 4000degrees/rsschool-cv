## About Me

A graduate of Minsk State Linguistic University. I have combined my passions for Language, IT, Environment, Civil Rights and Engineering in multiple roles.

From 2018 to 2021 I have divided my time between four projects. I have developed and supported a number of websites including r-turtle.art, kolostrumenj.by, ygallery.by. Whilst acting as a Project Assistant I have prepared project proposals, improved work processes by introducing Trello and Google products, provided English translations and subtitles. My desire to improve the environment has been satisfied by building air monitoring sensors for AirMQ project and plastic recycling machines for Zaduma project (based on Precious Plastic) in Belarus. As an engineer I have provided technical support in a number of ways including maintaining Linux servers, office networks, setting up exhibitions, fixing software and hardware problems.

Having relocated to Vilnius I am looking to specialize in an IT role, looking forward to enhancing my technical skills whilst working with more experienced team members.
